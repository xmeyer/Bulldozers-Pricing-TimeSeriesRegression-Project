# Bulldozers-Pricing-TimeSeriesRegression-Project

What I've learned from the hands on project:
> * Best practices for handling large time series data and making models (included personal experiences, like running models on his lunch break because he knew, as a professional machine learning engineer, it'd take awhile to finish running these models in his notebook)
> * Pandas and fundemental programming to acknowledge and fill missing data 
> * Preprocessing strategies for separate dataset files (train-validation csv file not apart of test csv file)
> * Reformatting predictions column to please Kaggle contest requirements
> * Creating a habit of writing functions for different machine learning or visualization uses
